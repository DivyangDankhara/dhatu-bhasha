# Vision

Dhātu-Bhāṣā is an experiment in **grammar-driven systems programming**.

It asks a simple but uncommon question:

> What if a programming language were designed the way Sanskrit was designed?

---

## Why Sanskrit?

Sanskrit is not only a natural language; it is a **formal, rule-based system**.
Classical Sanskrit grammar—most notably Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī—describes language using
ordered, deterministic rules that generate correct expressions.

Key characteristics:
- Root-based word formation (dhātu)
- Strict grammatical derivation
- Minimal ambiguity
- Powerful composition through compounds
- Separation of meaning and form

These properties closely resemble what we want in a programming language.

## Why Systems Programming?

Systems programming demands:
- predictability
- explicit control
- minimal abstraction cost
- direct interaction with hardware

Most modern languages prioritize convenience or safety at the cost of transparency.
Dhātu-Bhāṣā aims to explore whether **formal grammar** can provide structure *without*
hiding the machine.

## Design Philosophy

Dhātu-Bhāṣā follows these principles:

- **Grammar first**  
  Syntax is not arbitrary; it is derived from meaning.

- **Explicit over implicit**  
  Memory, lifetimes, and control flow should be visible.

- **Minimal magic**  
  No hidden runtime, no garbage collector.

- **Design before implementation**  
  Clear specification precedes code.

## Not a Replacement Language

Dhātu-Bhāṣā is not trying to replace C, Rust, or any existing language.

It is:
- a research-driven language design project
- a learning tool for compilers and systems programming
- an exploration of linguistic ideas applied to computing

Success is measured by **clarity and insight**, not adoption numbers.

---

## Open Source First

Dhātu-Bhāṣā is fully open source and community-driven.

The goal is to create:
- readable specifications
- approachable documentation
- a welcoming space for experimentation

Contributions of all kinds are encouraged.
